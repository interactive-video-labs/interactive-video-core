Welcome to `@interactive-video-labs/core` ‚Äî the framework-agnostic TypeScript module powering interactive video experiences. This engine is designed to be lightweight, extendable, and usable across React, Vue, or plain JavaScript apps.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with `@interactive-video-labs/core`, follow these steps:

### Installation

If you're integrating this module into an existing project, you can install it via `pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn`:

```bash
pnpm add @interactive-video-labs/core
# or
npm install @interactive-video-labs/core
# or
yarn add @interactive-video-labs/core
```

### Basic Usage

For a basic working example, refer to the [`examples/index.html`](examples/index.html) file. It demonstrates how to initialize and use the `IVLabsPlayer` in a plain HTML setup.

Here's a simplified snippet of how you might set up the player:

```typescript
import {
  IVLabsPlayer,
  InMemoryDecisionAdapter,
  LocalStorageDecisionAdapter,
} from '@interactive-video-labs/core';

// Initialize a decision adapter (e.g., for in-memory storage or local storage)
// const decisionAdapter = new InMemoryDecisionAdapter();
const decisionAdapter = new LocalStorageDecisionAdapter();

const playerConfig = {
  videoUrl: 'https://interactive-video-labs.github.io/assets/sample-video.mp4',
  cues: [
    {
      id: 'intro',
      time: 2,
      label: 'Introduction',
      payload: { message: 'Welcome!' },
    },
    {
      id: 'question1',
      time: 5,
      label: 'Question 1',
      payload: {
        interaction: {
          type: 'choice',
          title: 'Quick Question',
          description: 'Please select the correct answer.',
          question: 'What is 2+2?',
          options: ['3', '4', '5'],
          correctAnswer: '4',
        },
      },
    },
    {
      id: 'segmentChange',
      time: 10,
      label: 'Segment Change',
      payload: {
        interaction: {
          type: 'choice-video-segment-change',
          title: 'Choose your path',
          description: 'Select a video segment to jump to.',
          question: 'Where would you like to go?',
          options: [
            {
              level: 'Segment A',
              video: 'https://interactive-video-labs.github.io/assets/sample-interaction-1.mp4',
            },
            {
              level: 'Segment B',
              video: 'https://interactive-video-labs.github.io/assets/sample-interaction-2.mp4',
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    },
    {
      id: 'midpoint',
      time: 8,
      label: 'Midpoint',
      payload: { message: 'Halfway there!' },
    },
    {
      id: 'question2',
      time: 12,
      label: 'Question 2',
      payload: {
        interaction: {
          type: 'text',
          title: 'Your Information',
          description: 'Please enter your name below.',
          question: 'Your name?',
        },
      },
    },
    {
      id: 'end',
      time: 15,
      label: 'End',
      payload: { message: 'Thanks for watching!' },
    },
  ],
  initialState: 'idle',
  decisionAdapter: decisionAdapter, // Pass the decision adapter to the player config
};

// Assuming you have a div with id="player-container" in your HTML
const player = new IVLabsPlayer('player-container', playerConfig);

player.init();
// player.play(); // Start playback
```

### Decision Tracking and Persistence

The `@interactive-video-labs/core` module now supports tracking and persisting user decisions made during interactions. This is achieved through the `DecisionAdapter` interface, which allows you to define how decisions are stored and retrieved. Two concrete implementations are provided:

- **`InMemoryDecisionAdapter`**: Stores decisions in memory. This is useful for temporary tracking within a single session.
- **`LocalStorageDecisionAdapter`**: Stores decisions in the browser's local storage, providing persistence across sessions.

To use decision tracking, simply instantiate one of the adapters and pass it to the `IVLabsPlayer` configuration:

```typescript
import { IVLabsPlayer, LocalStorageDecisionAdapter } from '@interactive-video-labs/core';

const decisionAdapter = new LocalStorageDecisionAdapter();

const playerConfig = {
  // ... other player configurations
  decisionAdapter: decisionAdapter,
};

const player = new IVLabsPlayer('player-container', playerConfig);
player.init();

// To retrieve decision history:
async function getHistory() {
  const history = await decisionAdapter.getDecisionHistory();
  console.log('Decision History:', history);
}

// To clear decision history:
async function clearHistory() {
  await decisionAdapter.clearDecisionHistory();
  console.log('Decision History cleared.');
}
```

This allows you to easily integrate decision tracking into your interactive video experiences, enabling features like personalized content, progress saving, or analytics based on user choices.

## ‚ú® Features

The `@interactive-video-labs/core` engine includes the following core functionalities:

- **Core Player (`IVLabsPlayer`):** Orchestrates video playback, cue handling, interactions, and analytics.
- **State Machine:** Manages player state transitions (e.g., idle, playing, waitingForInteraction).
- **Cue Handler:** Manages and triggers cue points based on video time updates.
- **Interaction Manager:** Renders and manages various interaction types (choice, text, video segment changes) and handles user responses.
- **Analytics System:** Provides a flexible hook system for tracking player and interaction events.
- **Segment Manager:** Handles seamless transitions between different video segments.
- **Centralized Types:** Defines all core types and interfaces for consistency across the module.
- **Basic HTML Demo:** A raw HTML demo (`examples/index.html`) to validate core functionality without frameworks.
- **Testing Framework:** Utilizes Vitest for comprehensive unit testing.
- **Localization Support:** Enabled for broader audience reach.
- **Subtitle-based Cue Generation:** Supports generating cues from subtitles.
- **Multi-segment Video Lessons:** Capability to support video content divided into multiple segments.
- **Build and Publish Pipeline:** Configured for NPM publishing.
- **Decision Tracking and Persistence:** Supports tracking and persisting user decisions using configurable adapters (e.g., `InMemoryDecisionAdapter`, `LocalStorageDecisionAdapter`).
